## What is open GL
An open source graphics library that allows the programmer to create
draw visuals to the screen.


## How does it work?
OpenGL is basically one big state machine. The current state of
openGL is called the *context*. to do operations with OpenGL, we 
often change the context of the program, and then instruct
openGL to render that context.
